### [Observing weakly broken conservation laws in a dipolar Rydberg quantum spin chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02251v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-02T15:58:52Z

> Integrable quantum many-body systems host families of extensive conservation laws, some of which are fragile: even infinitesimal perturbations can qualitatively alter their dynamical constraints. Here we show that this fragility leaves a clear experimental fingerprint in a one-dimensional quantum spin chain of as few as 14 Rydberg atoms. Weak integrability breaking from interatomic dipolar couplings is directly detectable within experimentally accessible times in the dynamics of non-local observ...
