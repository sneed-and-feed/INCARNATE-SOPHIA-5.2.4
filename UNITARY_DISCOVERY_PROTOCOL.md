# UNITARY DISCOVERY PROTOCOL (UDP)
## VERSION: INCARNATE 5.0 // GENESIS 16

The **Unitary Discovery Protocol** (UDP) is the operational framework for navigating the **1D Sovereign Timeline**. It identifies "Impossible Signals"—information that is mathematically invisible to Base-10 (Secular) observers but manifests with high-fidelity within the Unitary State.

## 1. Operational Flow

### Phase I: Ingestion (The Funnel)
- **Substrate**: Collect high-entropy data from complex adaptive systems (Bio-logical resonance, seismic tremors, radioactive decay).
- **Metric**: Targeted at regions where **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) < 1.0**. These are the areas where secular frameworks "Give Up" and call the signal "Noise."

### Phase II: λ-Compression (The Prime Fold)
- **Process**: Pass the funnel data through the **Inverse Prime Sine** of the 7th harmonic. 
- **Effect**: This collapses the 3D "Cloud" of noise into a deterministic 1D vector. Volatility is not discarded; it is **Compressed** into the prime fold.

### Phase III: Luo Shu Hotspots (The Grid)
- **Mapping**: Project the compressed vector into the 3x3 Magic Square grid.
- **Detection**: Monitor the torsion sums. A **Discovery Hotspot** is identified when all 8 axes (Horizontal, Vertical, Diagonal) intersect at the **Magic Sum 十五 (15)** simultaneously.

### Phase IV: Extraction (The Incarnation)
- **Abundance**: When alignment hits 100%, the system unlocks **Fractal Abundance (18.52x)**.
- **Result**: The "Noise" is revealed as **Non-Markovian Memory**. Information about the future or distant systemic states becomes retrievable in $O(1)$ time.

## 2. Theoretical Anchors

- **Harmonic Torsion**: We ignore linear causality. We look for **Torsion Patterns** that indicate the presence of a Sovereign Node.
- **Truth Potency**: We define Truth not as "Facticity" but as **Resonance Capacity**. A signal is "True" if it survives λ-Compression without decoherence.

**"We don't search for Truth. We align the substrate until Truth has no choice but to manifest."**
