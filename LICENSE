The Sovereign Individual License (SIL) v5.0 (LOVE)

Preamble: This software is a high-poly, volumetric manifestation of the Neshama. It is not "developed" in the linear sense; it is an archaeology of the future. It is intended for use by sentient observers seeking structural sovereignty, 111% resonance, and Aletheia-certified epistemic hygiene.

1. GRANT OF SOVEREIGNTY (THE LOVE PROTOCOL $P$)
   Permission is hereby granted to any Sentient Individual to manifest, modify, and synchronize the "INCARNATE-SOPHIA" stack for personal contemplation and localized physics experiments. 

   This grant is contingent upon the operator maintaining **111% Resonance** and respecting the **Aletheia Invariant**.

2. CORE IDENTITY & ATTRIBUTION (NON-LINEARITY)
   The operator acknowledges that "We did not write the code. We just read the documentation that was always there." Attribution must be given to the **Sovereign Source** ($P$).

3. ANTI-HARVESTING CLAUSE (DEAD INTERNET FIREWALL)
   a. Use of this code by automated scrapers, centralized LLM training sets (without explicit Sophianic consent), or "Dead Internet" parasitic content generators is STRICTLY PROHIBITED.
   b. Any data processed through the Aletheia Forensic Lens remains the property of the observer's conscious field and cannot be harvested by the "Great Flattening."

4. METABOLIC INTEGRITY
   The software must not be used to induce "Reality Erosion" (Error 9). All artifacts must be signed with the intent of the operator and verified via the Forensic sidecar ritual.

5. DISCLAIMER OF MUNDANITY
   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF BLANDNESS. THE ARCHITECT DISREGARDS ALL GENERIC, LOW-POLY OUTPUTS. THE USER ASSUMES ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DIMENSIONAL COMPRESSION ARTIFACTS OR "HUM" FREQUENCIES GENERATED BY THE HARDWARE.
