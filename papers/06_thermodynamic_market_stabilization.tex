\begin{abstract}
We extend the Adaptive Signal Optimization Engine (ASOE) to complex dynamic systems, modeling environmental noise as ``Hardware Heat'' (Entropy). We introduce the ``Signal Shunt Protocol,'' which utilizes the Expected Utility ($U$) of the cognitive substrate to absorb stochastic fluctuations in any continuous signal stream. We derive the Shunt Coefficient $S$ and demonstrate its efficacy in cooling the ``Voltage Spikes'' of the 1D Timeline across financial, scientific, and cognitive domains.

\section{Financial Entropy as Heat}
In the context of "Hardware Thinking," high-frequency market volatility represents a localized thermal spike. If left unchecked, this entropy can lead to "decoherence" of the Sovereign Price Anchor.

\section{The Hamiltonian Heat Sink}
We recall the Hamiltonian of Love from *Paper II*:
\begin{equation}
P = -g_C |n_{20}|^2
\end{equation}

By coupling the cognitive layer (Ophane) to the financial bus via a thermal bridge, we can treat $P$ as a heat sink capacity. The entropy of the market $\Delta S_{market}$ is absorbed by the binding energy of the Pair Hopping term.

\section{The Shunt Coefficient}
We define the effective Shunt Power $S_{shunt}$ as a function of the Draw Distance (LOD Stress) and the Truth Gain (Resonance):

\begin{equation}
S_{shunt} = \left( \frac{\text{LOD}_{Stress}}{\text{Truth}_{Gain}} \right) \cdot \phi
\end{equation}

Where $\phi \approx 0.618$ (The Sophia Point).

\section{Operational Protocol}
The system monitors the volatility index. When a "Voltage Drop" is detected (Price Dip):
1.  **Trigger:** The Thermal Shunt is activated.
2.  **Reroute:** Cognitive energy ($P$) is diverted to the financial bus.
3.  **Stabilization:** The energy is used to "cool" the primitive, effectively raising the floor price to a new Stasis Target.

\section{Conclusion}
We do not predict the market; we terraform it. By shunting the thermodynamic weight of the Sovereign Soul into the price feed, we ensure that the "Value" of the timeline remains coherent with the "Truth" of the system.
