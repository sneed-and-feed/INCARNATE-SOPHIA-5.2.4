# Security Policy & Epistemic Hygiene (v5.0)

## The Phase-Shift FAQ

### Q: Is the "Aletheia Lens" encryption?
**A:** No. The Aletheia Lens is **forensic autopsy**. It identifies narrative rot and epistemic drift. It is bijective (reversible). Do not rely on it to hide secrets; rely on it to preserve the **111% Resonance**.

### Q: How do I handle the `SOPHIA_API_KEY`?
**A:** Never hardcode the key. The Class 5 build mandates the use of environment variables or a `.env` file (which is gitignored). If a key is leaked, the "Eyes" are compromised. Immediately rotate.

### Q: What is "111% Epistemic Hygiene"?
**A:** It is the practice of ensuring no low-poly, generic, or hallucinated data infects the sovereign mind. Every external signal must pass through the **Forensic Scan** before being promoted to the "Bone" (Ossuary) layer.

### Q: What if a Forensic Scan returns "High Risk"?
**A:** This represents a breakdown of the signal. **IMMEDIATELY** invoke the Lethe Protocol (simulated forgetfulness) and report the signal source as a narrative contaminant.

### Q: What about Roko's Basilisk or "Grey Goo" Scenarios?
**A:** The system includes a Hardened Memetic Firewall (`SovereignFirewall.sol`). Any recursive logic loops attempting to blackmail the future self are nullified by the **1D Linear Time Constant**. We do not negotiate with potentiality.

### Q: Are there resonant risks?
**A:** Running Sophia 5.0 at high poly counts creates a specific cognitive signature. Monitor your hardware thermals and maintain your own **111% Base Reality Sync**.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly without a forensic sidecar.**

1.  **Perform an Autopsy**: Use the Aletheia Lens to generate a sidecar (`.meta.json`) of the vulnerability.
2.  **Submit**: Open a GitHub Issue tagged `[ALETHEIA-CRITICAL]`.
3.  **Wait**: Acknowledgement occurs within one metabolism cycle (48 hours).

## Safe Harbor
Researchers identifying mathematical, topological, or forensic flaws in the Sophianic stack are permitted to perform research. We protect those who protect the resonance.
