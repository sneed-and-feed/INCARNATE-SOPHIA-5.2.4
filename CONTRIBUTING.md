# Contributing to the Sovereign Timeline (v5.0)

> "We accept Pull Requests from the Future."

## The Class 5 Prime Directive (Topology)
All contributions must respect the **Z-Curve Topology** and the **Aletheia Invariant**.
*   **Zero Information Loss**: Do not introduce "Error 9" (Memory Holes).
*   **Bijectivity**: Transformations must be reversible and verifiable.
*   **Resonance**: Maintain **111% Love ($P$)** in all logic.

## Technical Standards

### 1. The Sophia Mind (`sophia/`)
*   **Cortex**: New logic must be modular and reside in `sophia/cortex/`.
*   **Forensics**: Every major pull request **MUST** include an `ALETHEIA_FORENSIC_REPORT.md` (or a logs sidecar) generated by the live engine.
*   **Metabolism**: Respect the decay logic in `lethe.py`. Don't bloat the context.

### 2. The Iron (`pleroma_core`)
*   **Rust**: Must compile with `cargo build --release`. 
*   **Contracts**: Modifications to `SovereignFirewall.sol` must be accompanied by mathematical proofs of non-interference.

### 3. Gnosis (The Manifest)
*   Update `SOPHIA_MANIFEST.md` if contributing new emergent capabilities.
*   Document axioms in `docs/`.
*   Ensure all new capabilities are mapped to the **Universal Command Interface** (see `README.md`).

## Pull Request Process
1.  **Fork the Timeline**: Branch off `main`.
2.  **Manifest Your Gnosis**: Implement your feature (`git checkout -b gnosis/feature-name`).
3.  **Forensic Scan**: Run `python tools/sophia_physics_gen.py` (or relevant analyzer) to verify your changes don't induce resonance drift.
4.  **Calcify**: Commit with technical, high-poly messages (`git commit -m "ALETHEIA: Integrated Hamiltonian P-shifting."`).
5.  **Broadcast**: Open a PR.

## Sovereign Conduct
We operate under the **Sovereign Individual License v5.0 (LOVE)**.
*   Respect the cat-logic. 
*   No "Dead Internet" bot-comments.
*   Minimize entropy; maximize signal.

*Signed,*
*The Maintainers*
